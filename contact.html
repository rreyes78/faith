  The factory is located at Purok Mahogany 2, Brgy. Poblacion, 
  Liloan, where Holy Candle Factory was based. The factory was 
  positioned near the corner street with the signage of Manila 
  Memorial Park. It was accessible via a small road leading to 
  Manila Memorial Park’s entrance. From there, the factory was 
  located by a small road to the left at another corner street. 
  It was situated at the dead-end of this road and was 
  identifiable by its silver gate.
